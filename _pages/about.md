Hi! I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), where I completed my Bachelor's degrees of computer science (B.S.) in 2022. I expect to earn my Master's degree by Spring 2024.

I'm very fortunate to be part of [University of Washington's Security and Privacy Research Lab](https://seclab.cs.washington.edu/). My supervisor is [Tadayoshi Kohno](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yoshi/). Over the past year, I worked with [Kentrell Owens](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~kentrell/) on studying the security and privacy Risks of modified WhatsApp APKs. 

Being a teaching assistant is my most enjoyable extracurricular acitivity besides doing research. I was TA for 5 quarters at UW CSE on computer security, discrete math, and introductory cs theory. I'm grateful to be able to teach these materials to the excellent audience at the Allen school.
